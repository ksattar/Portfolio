A collection of economics projects using techniques in machine learning, natural language processing, and time series


**NLP:**  Part-of-speech tagging is a common task in Natural Language Processing. Using dynamic programming to solve a Hidden Markov Model, here I code an implementation of the Viterbi algorithm to label parts of speech in a body of text.

**Microfinance:**  This is the abstract from my senior thesis, "Measuring Risk in Informal Credit Markets." I spent 4 months conducting household surveys in India and Bangladesh to understand how the poor save and borrow money without access to banks. I used this data to numerically test a game-theoretic model of informal lending.

**Small Business:**  I am interested in understanding the drivers of small business loan performance. Using data from the Small Business Administration's 7a program, I will use machine learning techniques to build a classification model for chargeoff (default) status.

**Uganda:**  I am interested to predict the probability of drought in certain regions of Uganda. Using geocoded weather data, I will build a spatial forecasting model. This is part of my volunteer work for Columbia University's Engineers Without Borders program, through which I've had the opportunity to do data analytics and field research on an agriculture project in Eastern Uganda. We are currently assessing the impacts of potential infrastructure projects based on, in part, the effects of climate change on local needs.
