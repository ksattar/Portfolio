*I am interested to predict the probability of drought in certain regions of Uganda.
Using geocoded weather data, I will build a spatial forecasting model.*

*This is part of my volunteer work for Columbia University's Engineers Without Borders
program, through which I've had the opportunity to do data analytics and field research
on an agriculture project in Eastern Uganda. We are currently assessing the impacts
of potential infrastructure projects based on, in part, the effects of climate change on
local needs.*

*For example, we are considering building a rope bridge across a river that usually floods
every summer, which makes passage difficult for children going to school. However, if
there has been a structural shift in Uganda's flood cycles due to climate change,
it's possible that floods will become less frequent in the future and the need for
irrigation and water storage projects will increase.*
