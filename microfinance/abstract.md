ABSTRACT

In developing countries, the poor often lack access to commercial banking services. They
borrow money from moneylenders and microfinance institutions. These transactions are marked
by high risk that is difficult to estimate. As a result of this risk, lenders minimize their losses
by limiting the supply of loans. This limited supply of credit is a market imperfection--some
borrowers cannot obtain loans at any price. In a cross-sectional analysis of credit markets in 10
countries, I seek to identify the cause of unmet credit demand in each.
